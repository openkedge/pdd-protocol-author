# PDD Bundle Spec

Use this reference when writing or reviewing a PDD bundle.

## protocol.yaml

Required fields:

- `protocol.name`: stable slug.
- `protocol.version`: semantic version.
- `protocol.status`: `draft`, `review`, `sealed`, or `deprecated`.
- `purpose`: one paragraph.
- `boundary.in_scope`: what the protocol governs.
- `boundary.out_of_scope`: what it does not govern.
- `handshakes`: schema references.
- `invariants`: references to invariant files.
- `capabilities`: reference to capability manifest.
- `validators`: reference to validation plan.
- `evidence`: reference to evidence requirements.

## Invariant Files

Each invariant should include:

- `id`: stable machine-readable identifier.
- `statement`: human-readable rule.
- `severity`: `must`, `should`, or `may`.
- `rationale`: why the invariant exists.
- `validation`: one or more validation mechanisms.

Use `must` for admission requirements. Use `should` only when failure does not reject admission.

## Capability Manifest

Operational authority should be explicit. Include:

- network access and allowed destinations.
- disk I/O and allowed paths.
- database operation limits.
- external service dependencies.
- secret/environment variable access.
- latency, memory, CPU, and concurrency budgets.
- logging and telemetry boundaries.

## Ambiguity Log

Maintain two sections:

- `Resolved assumptions`: decisions made to produce the bundle.
- `Open questions`: questions that may require a protocol revision.

Blocking ambiguity prevents sealing. Non-blocking ambiguity can be recorded as an assumption.

## Evidence Requirements

Evidence should be sufficient to answer:

- Which protocol version governed admission?
- Which artifact was validated?
- Which validators ran?
- What results were observed?
- What dependencies and environment were used?
- Can the decision be replayed or audited?
